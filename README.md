# TouhouRemixSearch
A small program that searches through my Touhou song remixes according to the original song.

Since I am currently learning Java in school, I'm going to try to make this using Java. Thus, this is more of a learning experience for me.

The program is supposed to:

-Create a text file of all of the songs in the current directory. This is were the user can add tags to the songs.

-Search through a directory (to make things easier for me I'm going to start by searching through only 1 directory)

-Take a "tag" as an input and output files with that "tag".
