# TouhouRemixSearch
A small program that searches through my Touhou song remixes according to the original song.

Since I am currently learning Java in school, I'm going to try to make this using Java.

The program is supposed to:
-Be able to "tag" files to make it possible to search for them
-Search through a directory (to make things easier for me I'm going to start by searching through only 1 directory)
-Take a "tag" as an input and search for files with that "tag".
